# Neural functional theory for inhomogeneous fluids: Fundamentals and applications

This repository contains code, datasets and models corresponding to the following publication:

**Neural functional theory for inhomogeneous fluids: Fundamentals and applications**  
*Florian Samm√ºller, Sophie Hermann, Daniel de las Heras, and Matthias Schmidt, submitted (2023); [arXiv:2307.04539](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04539).*


### Instructions

You need to have a working install of Tensorflow/Keras, see the guide at [https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip).
Additionally, the code requires the Python modules `numpy`, `scipy` and `matplotlib`.

Simulation datasets can be found in `data` and trained models are located in `models`.
A sample script for training a model from scratch is given in `learn.py`.
The usage of a trained model, e.g. for the self-consistent calculation of density profiles, is illustrated in `neuraldft.py`.
Some useful utilities are provided in `utils.py`, such as tools for functional calculus as well as data generators and callbacks for training.


### Further information

The reference data has been generated with grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations using [MBD](https://gitlab.uni-bayreuth.de/bt306964/mbd).
The analytic DFT calculations with fundamental measure theory have been performed with the Julia library [ClassicalDFT.jl](https://gitlab.uni-bayreuth.de/bt306964/ClassicalDFT.jl).
